  <h1>Emotional intelligence by Daniel Goleman</h1>

  <img src="emotional_intelligence.jpg" alt="">

  <p>Emotional intelligence is a book that I had an opportunity to read, which gave me a big insight in how to do things more effectively using my emotions. The book focuses massively on the emotional part of us humans (that is where the name comes
    from) and how knowledge in that area can help us more than the IQ in our daily lives. Daniel describes that there have been studies that have shown people with an emotional knowledge had far more capability and were more likely to be someone of a
    high position in society than the people of high IQ. Daniel’s book describes many situations that have a possibility of happening in our daily lives, and there he describes how some of them can be solved in a much better way for a positive
    outcome with the help of emotional knowledge. Daniel puts a lot of energy and effort into the part where he describes the evolution of a child and the process from day 1 to adulthood. He describes how there are signs that children give and the
    way some parents communicate with their children, and how that already from a young age, can predict a child’s position in adulthood and the way it will behave. He also points out the fact that things don’t have to be permanent and that there is
    always a possibility for a change, and gives us the knowledge on how to approach these situations differently.</p>
